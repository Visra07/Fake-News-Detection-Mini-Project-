# Fake News Detection Mini Project 2020
## ABSTRACT
A lot of things we read online, especially in the news, may seem true, but often they are not. False or unverified information is disseminated as accurate information on the web, which can go viral and influence public opinion and decisions. People intentionally disseminate these counterfeit articles using online social media sites. The ultimate goal of fake news sites is to influence popular beliefs on specific topics. The main purpose of fake news websites is to affect public opinion on certain issues.

The proliferation of fake news on social media and the internet is misleading people to an extent that must be stopped. Current systems are not efficient when it comes to giving an accurate statistical assessment of a certain news item. Also, restrictions on entry and category of news make it less varied. We have found a reliable model that classifies a dataset as it can tell the difference between “real” and “fake” information using machine learning techniques.


## INTRODUCTION
### About the project
Unauthentic news refers to fake news published under the pretext of being real news, commonly referred to as “fake news”. Fake news is now considered one of the biggest threats to democracy, journalism, and freedom of expression. The scope of the fake news was that India called on Pakistan to make motivated false propaganda on social media. During the period, Facebook suspended 103 pages, 78 groups, 453 Facebook accounts, and 107 Instagram accounts for engaging in unauthentic coordinated behavior. Our economies are not immune to the spread of counterfeits news, because fake news is related to stock market fluctuations and large transactions. The main reason is that fake news can be created and published online faster and more cheaply compared to traditional news. Media such as newspapers and television. 
The contagion of fake news has pervaded the world in equal measure. Deeply linked to technological progress, “disinformation” and “disinformation” have become omnipresent in our information bubbles. As the world's largest democracy with the second largest population, the issue of fake news poses a unique threat to India. Low literacy rates not only make it difficult to implement the true spirit of democratic decision-making, but add to it an explosion of fake news and divisive propaganda, and there is a real threat to the democratic fabric of the country. Information disseminated online can have serious repercussions and potential substantial political and economic benefits. The generous profits encourage malicious entities to create, publish, and distribute false information.
### Objective
The main objective is to differentiate between "real" and "fake" news that can be used by users. We need to build a model with machine learning technologies and natural language processing functions.
